THis is a photograph of my daughter Alicia
At the time she was about 8 months old
This is an important time in a babies life for many reasons
But one of the reasons that is most interesting to me has to do with language
We've learned that babies have the ability to distinguish between all of the 
possible sounds of the worlds languages
This is really quite impressive

- babies and bilingualism
  - kuhl and colleagues summary
  - cognitive flexibility to navigate multiple phonetic systems
  - cognitive flexibility to navigate complex linguistic situations
